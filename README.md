# twitch24

prof of concept: to experiment with qunit, pure javascript,
AMD module design and requireJS with Bootstrap.


v0.1.1: This alpha, single page app (non-angular, non-react) pulls data from the Twitch api
and allows the user to track the online/offline status of 24 user chosen channels
and stores them via localStorage

### Run the test suite:

navigate to the main `index.html` file and uncomment these lines
```html
<div id="qunit"></div>
<div id="qunit-fixture"></div>

```
